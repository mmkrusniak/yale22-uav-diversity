/**
 * This package includes all classes which define the UAV model the simulator uses. All path planning algorithms we
 * have investigated are implemented here, including those found in the literature, simple / naive cases, and our own
 * solutions.
 *
 * It also includes some code defining the basic abstractions of the simulated drone.
